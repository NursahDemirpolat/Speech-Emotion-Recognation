# Speech-Emotion-Recognation
Communication is very important for living things, every living thing has a different communication way. People can use both body language and communicate by speaking.
In our project, we designed it in a way that focuses on finding out what emotion it is in by recording the sound of the speech used to communicate and then analyzing it.
We decided to make our project inspired by working mothers. Today, many mothers are working and their children have to stay at home. As much as I observed around me, they usually communicate with their mothers by sending voice notes through a communication application.
In this case, people cannot distinguish the emotions of every sound and cannot understand what emotion their child is in at that moment. The application we made does not only address children but also appeals to every human age. Considering what we wrote above, we tried to analyze the sound and find its emotion.
We used 3 algorithms in our project
MFCC
PITCHES
CHROMA
Thanks to the algorithms we used, we analyzed the sound, and by bringing these analyzes to an ancestor, we created a number, since each number has a feeling, we reflected the emotions corresponding to the numbers on the screen.
